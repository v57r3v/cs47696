QUESTION 2 – Cost Understanding Nebula   Enterprises   is   a   leading   manufacturer   of   a   high-quality   game   console   called   Orion.   With   the   rising popularity of augmented reality (AR) games, the company plans to introduce a new AR accessory   called   Vega    in    2023.   Alongside   this,   their    marketing    manager,    Alex,    is    considering   a    promotional   campaign   offering   a   free   VR   headset   with   each   purchase   of   the   Vega   product   to   boost   sales   in   the   initial   months.
The following   information   has   been   provided:
Current Product (Orion) New Product (Vega) Sales (units) 90,000 110,000 Selling price per unit ($) 250 220 Variable cost per unit ($) 225 180 Total fixed costs ($) 1,000,000 1,300,000 
If the   promotional campaign   proceeds, there will   be an additional fixed   cost   of   $150,000   and   each VR   headset will   incur a cost of $10   per   unit   for   the   company.
Required: (a)                      (i)                      Calculate the   breakeven   point   in   revenue for   the   Orion   and   Vega   products,   respectively,

(ii)                   Calculate the   profit for the Orion   product   based on the given   data.    (1   mark)
(iii)             Calculate       the       profit      for      the      Vega       product      based      on      the      given      data,      without      the   promotional campaign.    (1   mark)
(iv)             Calculate   the    additional   total    costs    associated   with   the    promotional   campaign   for   the   Vega   product.    (1   mark)

(vi)             Compare   the   profits   before   and   after   introducing   the   Vega   product   with   its   promotional   campaign.   Discuss   Nebula   Enterprises’ financial   performance   post-launch   in   light of your   findings.       (2   marks –   100 words   maximum)Nebula Enterprises, renowned for its in-house production, is considering an offer from a manufacturer   in    Country    Z,    recently      scrutinised    for      poor      labour      standards,      to      produce      its      Vega      product      (i.e.,   outsource    production)    rather   than   to    manufacture    it    themselves.   The    manufacturer    in    Country   Z   proposes:   (i) a   production cost of $165   per   unit for the Vega   product with a   minimum   order   of   80,000   units,   and   (ii)   a   charge   of   $5   per   unit   for   shipping   costs.   Accepting   this   offer   would   nullify   Nebula   Enterprises’   variable   costs   related   to   manufacturing   the   Vega   product   themselves.   Moreover,   this   would   also   allow   Nebula   Enterprises to   lease   part   of their   manufacturing facility,   generating   $12   per   Vega    unit   sold   in   revenue.
(i)                      Determine   the    net   financial   impact   of   accepting   the   manufacturer   in   Country   Z’s   offer   versus   if   Nebula   Enterprises   manufactures   the Vega   product themselves   in-house.   Briefly   discuss which option   is the   best.   (Ignore the   promotional costs). (5   marks)(ii)                   Discuss two   potential   reputational   risks that   Nebula   Enterprises might face if they decide to outsource the   production of the Vega   product to the   manufacturer   in Country   Z.

QUESTION 3 – Performance Measurement ClearWater   Ltd   is   known   for   its   bottled   natural   spring   water.   Their   premium   offering,   AquaPure,   is   marketed    as    being    sourced    from    pristine    mountain    springs,    a    claim    that    appeals    to    a    significant   segment   of customers who   prefer   pure   and   untouched water sources.   Every   month,   they   forecast   to   bottle and sell around   20,000   units of AquaPure.However,   of   late,   unsettling   rumors   have   been   circulating,   suggesting   that   ClearWater   Ltd   might   be   compromising   its   commitment   to   quality.   Allegedly,   some   batches   of   AquaPure   are   being   sourced   from    non-spring   sources,    raising   questions    about   the   authenticity   of   ClearWater    Ltd’s    claims   and   potentially   misleading   its dedicated customer   base.
In August, amidst these   rumors, the company’s anticipated   and   actual   costs   were   as   follows:
Anticipated Costs for each AquaPure unit August Actual Production 18,000 units Direct Materials $1.00 (Bottle and Label) $18,500 Direct Labour 0.5 hours at $10.00 hourly 9,000 hours, costing $90,000 Variable Manufacturing Overhead 0.5 hours at $5.00 hourly $85,000 Fixed Manufacturing Overhead $50,000 $48,000 Total Actual Costs $241,500

(i)       From    an    ethical   standpoint,      evaluate   the    potential    implications   of   the    rumors    regarding   ClearWater   Ltd’s   water   sourcing.   What   are   the   broader   moral   ramifications   of   potentially   misleading customers about the   purity and source   of AquaPure?                   (2   marks –   100 words   maximum)
(ii)      Analyse   how   these   rumors   and   the   ethical   concerns   they   raise   might   influence   ClearWater   Ltd’s costs, sales, and overall   brand   reputation. What potential financial repercussions could   ClearWater   Ltd face   if these   rumors are   validated?    (2   marks –   100 words   maximum)
(d)                Balanced   Scorecard   Perspectives   and   Corrective   Measures:
(i)       Using       the       balanced       scorecard       approach,       identify       which       two       perspectives       are       most   jeopardized   by   these   rumors.   How   might   these   perspectives   be   adversely   affected   by   the   circulating   speculations?    (2   marks –   100 words   maximum)
(ii)       Suggest   appropriate   measures   and   actions   ClearWater    Ltd   should   undertake   for   damage   control.   How   can   the   company   ensure   transparency   in   the   future   to   rebuild   trust   with   its   stakeholders?
